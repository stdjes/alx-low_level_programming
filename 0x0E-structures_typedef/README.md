#0x0E C - Structures,Typedef

## Structures
Structures are a way of grouping related data together in a single unit. They are declared using the struct keyword, and the members of a structure are accessed using the . operator.

##Typedef
Typedef is a keyword that is used to give a new name to an existing data type. This can be useful for making code more readable, or for creating new data types that are based on existing ones.

Structures and typedef are two powerful features of the C programming language. They can be used to make code more readable and reusable, and they can also be used to create new data types that are tailored to specific needs.
