#0x0F. C - Function pointers

##Learning Objectives:

 - What are function pointers and how to use them
 - What does a function pointer exactly hold
 - Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

###Basic Concept

Function pointers are a powerful and advanced concept in programming languages that support pointers, such as C and C++. Unlike regular pointers that point to data variables, a function pointer, as the name suggests, points to executable code â€“ the address of a function within memory. This capability allows us to treat functions as data, enabling dynamic function calls and greater flexibility in program design.

Function pointers open the door to various useful programming techniques, such as callbacks, where a function can be passed as an argument to another function for dynamic behavior. They also facilitate the implementation of function dispatch tables, enabling efficient selection and execution of functions based on runtime conditions. By using function pointers, programmers gain the ability to create more generic and reusable code, enhancing modularity and code readability.

However, using function pointers requires a solid understanding of memory management and function signatures. Their syntax might seem unfamiliar at first, but with practice, they become an invaluable tool in a programmer's arsenal, providing elegant solutions to complex problems and enabling greater control over program flow.
