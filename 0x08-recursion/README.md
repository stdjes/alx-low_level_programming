# 0x03 - Recursion in C

Recursion is the calling of a function inside itself(the same function that is calling it).

This is a very useful but confusing concept in ptogramming. It can however be used to solve problems with simple repetitive patterns such as

- Fibonacci series
- Factorials
- Sum of natural numbers
- and much more complex problems
